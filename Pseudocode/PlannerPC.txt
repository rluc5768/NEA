state is initialised for all days of the week.

On page load, call  GET "/workout_plan" (if no workout_plan is specified in header, returns active plan).
THEN, 
iterate through the returned dicts and set each state object to what is in the response.
If all objects are undefined/null, render a no workout active.
Otherwise,
    Render the not null 'cards'/state for the workout.
